                For the current you, life is all about exploring the wonders of
                parenthood. You love the moments you share with budding family
                and can’t wait to discover more together. You’re someone who’s
                imaginative and always on-the-go.

                People close to you will never see you sitting still and just
                waiting for things to happen. You’re likely to invite people out
                at 3am for an early breakfast or book flights whenever there’s a
                seat sale. You’re brave, rarely anxious, and not easily
                influenced by people as you tend to go on your own flow.
